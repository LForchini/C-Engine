# C-Engine

This is essentially a wrapper for SDL2 that makes my life a bit easier.
It isn't horribly complicated and is missing a lot, however if I need a feature I promptly implement it.
A big issue is that I modify the engine in other projects and then don't update it here, so there may be many different custom version.
This is the definitive version, and if someone is dumb enough to use this engine, at least use this version.

The only requirement is SDL2 until I implement images.
Once I do that, I will update installation instructions.

## Install

### MacOS

Install SDL2 using `brew install --cask sdl2`

### Linux (apt)

Install SDL2 using `sudo apt-get install sdl2`

### Linux (pacman)

Install SDL2 using `sudo pacman -Syu sdl2`
